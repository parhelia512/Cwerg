## Cwerg Language Macros

Macros were not part of the initial vision of Cwerg because of their 
implementation complexity and the loss of readability they often 
create in code using them.

On the other hand macros make it easy to provide feature like:
* syntactic sugar
* lazy evaluation as needed for logging, etc.
* printf like functionality

As a compromise a fairly restricted macro system with the following properties was added:

* only a small number (< 10) of additional AST nodes where introduced to support macros.
* several other AST nodes like `for` and `while` could be replaced by macros and were removed.
* macros and their invocation are represented in the ASTs so the existing parser could be used
  almost unchanged
* macros expansion occurs before types resolution and partial evaluation so these and later phases
  of the compiler do not need to change
* since partial evaluation follow macro expansion #if style conditional compilation is NOT available
* macro definitions can only occur at the top (aka module) level
* macro invocations can only occur inside function bodies
* hygenic macros are supported by per macro invocation unique symbols
* macro invocations can be nested, macros invcotion inside macro argument are expanded before parents, 
* macros can invoke other macros, exapansion happens "outside-in", meaning the macro is expanded
  first, then any macros in the expanded macro body are themselves expanded.

### Macro Definition

Macro definitions have the form: 

```
(macro <name> 
    [<parameter1> <parameter2> ...] 
    [<unique-id1> <unique-id2> ...] :
        <body-node1> 
        <body-node2>
        ...)
```
`ParameterX` have the form: `(macro_parameter <name> <kind>)`

`Unique-idX` are indentfier placeholder which get instantiated at each dynamic expansion.

`Body-nodeX` represent the AST nodes used for expansion.

`name` and `unique-id` must start with `$` which is not permitted for identifiers outside of macros.

`Kind` is one of the following:
* `ID`: argument is a `Id` node (only the Id `name` is relevant)
* `STMT_LIST`: argument is a `MacroListArg` node (usually containing statement nodes)
* `EXPR`:  argument is an expression node
* `FIELD`:  argument is a `Id` node (only the Id `name` is relevant and refers to struct field)
* `TYPE`:  argument is a type node

### Macro Invocations


A macro invocation has the form:
```
(macro_invoke <name> [<arg1> < arg2> ...])
```

However, a invocation can be abbreviated like so:
```
(<name> <arg1> < arg2> ...)
```

which looks like a regular AST node and hence can be used
to create syntactic sugar.

`argX` is an AST node. A special node `EphemeralList` 
can be used when the argument is logically a list of nodes.

### Simple example: c-style -> operator

In C `p->next` is equivalent to `(*p).next`.
In Cwerg this can be expressed as a macro:

```
(# "^ is the reference operator in Cwerg")

(macro -> [(macro_param $pointer EXPR) 
           (macro_param $field FIELD)] [] [
    (. (^ $pointer) $field)
])
```

A corresponding macro invocation:

```
(-> list_pointer next)
```

which is short for

```
(macro_invoke -> [list_pointer next])
```

After expansion:

```
 (. (^ list_pointer) next)
```


### Another example: while loop

Given the macro:

```
(macro while [(macro_param $cond EXPR) 
              (macro_param $body STMT_LIST)] [] :
    (block :
          (if $cond [] [(break)])
          $body
          continue
    )
)   
```

This code:
```
(while (!= i 1) :
   (stmt call print [i])
   (if (== (% i 2) 0) :
        (= i (/ i 2)) 
   :
        (= i (+ (* i 3) 1)))
)
```

which is short for
```
(macro_invoke while [(!= i 1) (EphemeralList colon [
    (stmt call print [i])
    (if (== (% i 2) 0) :
        (= i (/ i 2))
    :  
         (= i (+ (* i 3) 1)))
]))
```

After expansion:
```
(block [
    (if (!= i 1) [] [(break)])
    (stmt call print [i])
    (if (== (% i 2) 0)  [(= i (/ i 2))]  [(= i (+ (* i 3) 1))])
    continue
])

```
### Hygienic Macros: simple example

The `swap` macro can be implemented like so:
```
(macro swap [(macro_param $a EXPR) (macro_param $b EXPR)] [$t] [
    (macro_let $t auto $a)
    (= $a $b)
    (= $b $t)
])
```

'$t' denotes a temporary variable. To prevent the actual
name of `$t` from clashing with `$a` or `$b` it will uniquely generated everytime the 
macro in expanded.


### Hygienic Macros: for loop over range

```
(# "loop over range equivalent to Python's range($start, $end, $step)")
(macro for [(macro_param $index ID) 
            (macro_param $type TYPE) 
            (macro_param $start EXPR) 
            (macro_param $end EXPR) 
            (macro_param $step EXPR) 
            (macro_param $body STMT_LIST)] [$end_eval $step_eval $it] :
    (macro_let $end_eval $type $end)
    (macro_let $step_eval $type $step)
    (macro_let mut $it $type $start)
    (block :
          (if (>= $it $end_eval) : 
            break 
          :)
          (macro_let $index auto $it)
          (+=  $it $step_eval)
          $body
          continue
    )
)
```

Sample invocation:
```
(for i uint32 0 (* 10 10) 1 [
  (stmt call print [i])
])
```

Note the use of `$end_eval`,  `$step_eval` and `$it`.
These identifiers will be bound to a new unique name
picked for each perfromed macro expansion. 
This will guarantee the absence of name clashes and/or involuntary capture.

`(macro_let $var ...)` defines a new variable whose name
is detemined by the macro argument or macro_gen_id `$var`. 

After expansion:
```
(let end_eval_$312 uint32 (* 10 10))
(let step_eval_$312 uint32 1)
(let mut it_$312 uint32 0)
(block :
      (if (>= it_$312 end_eval_$312) [(break)] [])
      (let_indirect i auto it_$312)
      (+=  it_$312 step_eval_$312)
      (stmt call print [i])
      continue
)
```


### Codegen loops in macros

The macro system features a simple looping mechanism to iterate over
`EXPR_LIST` parameters

Example:
```
(macro product [(macro_param $result ID) (macro_param $factors STMT_LIST)] [] :
    (macro_for $x $factors :
        (= $result (* $result $x))
    )
)

```

Sample invocation:

```
(let mut result u32 1)
(product result [111 (* 2 111) 333 444 555 666])
```


After expansion:
```
(let mut result u32 1)
(= result (* result 111))
(= result (* result (* 2 111)))
(= result (* result 333)
(= result (* result 444)
(= result (* result 555))
(= result (* result 666))
```
