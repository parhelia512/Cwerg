; canonical huffman tree decoder

; https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1951 Section 3.2

;
;
; Usage:
;
; Assumptions:
; * encoded was as set symbols numbered 0-MAX_SYMBOLS
; * for each symbol the width of the associated huffman code was recorded in a length slice
; * unused symbols have a widths of 0
; * we do not need to know the actual code for a symbol because we use canonical codes
;
module:

import bitstream

pub global BAD_SYMBOL u16 = 0xffff

pub global BAD_TREE_ENCODING u16 = 0xffff

global MAX_SYMBOLS uint = 0xff00

; Decode the next symbol from a bitstream
;
; This function has two failure modes:
; * the bitstream may run out of bits
;   This must be checked by the caller
; * the retrieved bits are out of range
;   This will result in BAD_SYMBOL to be returned
;
;   counts[i] contains the number of huffman code of 2^i
;   Note counts[0] is not used
;
