# C-Lite Frontend For Cwerg (Deprecated)

This simplified C compiler frontend was the original starting point of the Cwerg project.

Most of the heavy lifting is done by Eli Bendersky's
(pycparser)[https://github.com/eliben/pycparser] lexer/parser for C99.

This component is unlikely to get much love in the foreseeable future.
If you are looking for something more mature, you might save yourself some time by looking at the survey of other C-compilers which  can be found below.

## Project Status

* the supported part of the C language is whatever is in `TestData/*c`
  (this implies that the development is test driven)
  Expect the following **not** to work
  * typedefs
  * bitfields
  * vararg (except for limited support of printf)
  * post --/++
* the canonicalizer is already useful. It transforms C programs into
  equivalents programs that use a smaller subset of the C language.
  For example, canonicalized programs do not
  use pre/post in-/decrement and do not have for or while loops.
* translate.py contains a somewhat hacky Cwerg backend

Note: the tests in this directory are only testing the canonicalizer

The Cwerg code generation is exercised by ../Makefile.integration

## High Level Overview

The compilation is split into the following phases:

* Parse the code with pycparser into an AST

* Extract symbol and type information from the AST so that we can map
  each ID node to a declaration and each expression node to a type.

  This is currently done by creating edges from nodes within the AST
  to other nodes inside the AST and new nodes.

  Instead of inventing a new type system we use the nodes from pycparser

 * Canonicalize the c code so we can keep the backend simple

   This effectively de-sugars some syntax like compound assigns and
   pre/post increment/decrement, loops, etc.

   We can test the canonicalization transformations by re-emitting c-code
   and ensuring that the transformed code has the same output as the original
   code.
