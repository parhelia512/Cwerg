/*
We employs a number of unconventional mechanism to improve translation
performance. These mechanism are not hidden behind an API and need some time to
getting used to.

Information pertaining to a specific entity, say a Basic Block (Bbl),
is not stored in one massive struct but is broken up into several smaller
entities say one for core information and one for liveness information, etc.
Each of these are stored in an array called a Stripe.

The collection of all `Stripes` pertaining to an entity is called
a `StripeGroup`.
This resembles a `array of structs` approach
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA) which greatly improves
locality.

Since the information belonging to an entity is spread (`striped`) across
multiple memory regions entities are not identified by pointers but
`Handles` which are essentially indices into the `Stripes`.

Since `Handles` are 32 bit they also save memory on 64 bit systems
where ordinary pointers would consume twice the space.

The first stripe in a stripe group is used to manage the free list and
must have the size of two handles (2 * 4 bytes).

To make accessing `Stripes` less syntactically obtrusive all `Stripes`
are global objects.

STL containers are still used in places where performance does not matter
much but we generally try to avoid them.
